            <p>  I usually don't like writing reviews but I use this site 
                for everything. It's easy to use and a lifesafer. It's cut 
                down so much energy on the stuff I do everyday.
                The tips I have read are common-sense, and attainable.
                Every one of the posts has given me a new perspective
                on a better way to spend my time, money and energy.
                I've tried the other sites but,
                "How To" is by far the best.<span>--Johnathan Jackson</span>

            <p> Sweet mother, do I hate wasting time on all the day to
                day tasks! I'm a mother of 4 and I'm working for 6 people
                everyday. My family and I love to go have fun together so 
                anything that can help me move along our daily chore list
                helps. I have scoured the internet for life hack sites
                like this one, and is this one the best? Absolutely! I have
                never found content like the content on this site. I tell ALL 
                of my friends about "How To". 
                IT IS THE BEST!<span>--Amy Wilkerson</span>
